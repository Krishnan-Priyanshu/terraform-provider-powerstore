## Schema

### Optional

- **appliance_id** (String) Unique identifier of the appliance on which the volume is
provisioned
- **created_by_rule_id** (String) Created by rule id
- **created_by_rule_name** (String) Created by rule name
- **creation_timestamp** (String) Time when the volume was created
- **creator_type** (String) Creator type
- **creator_type_l10n** (String)
- **description** (String) Description of the volume. This value must contain 128 or
fewer printable Unicode characters.
**Maximal length** : 128
- **expiration_timestamp** (String)
- **family_id** (String)
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **is_app_consistent** (Boolean)
- **is_replication_destination** (Boolean) Indicates whether this volume is a replication destination.
A replication destination will be created by the system
when a replication session is created. When there is an
active replication session, all the user operations are
restricted including modification, deletion, host operation,
snapshot, clone, etc. After the replication session is deleted,
the replication destination volume will remain as it is until
the end user changes it to be a non-replication destination.
After the change, it becomes a primary volume. If the end
user keeps it as a replication destination, when the
replication session is recreated, the replication destination
volume could potentially be reused in the new session to
avoid a time-consuming full sync. This property is only
valid for primary and clone volumes.
Default : false
- **location_history** (String) Filtering on the fields of this embedded resource is not
supported.
- **migration_session_id** (String) Unique identifier of the migration session assigned to the
volume if it is part of a migration activity.
- **name** (String) Name of the volume. This value must contain 128 or fewer
printable Unicode characters. This property supports caseinsensitive filtering
Maximal length : 128
- **node_affinity** (String) Node affinity. Node which offers optimized IO for volume,
**values are:** System_Select_At_Attach, System_Selected_Node_A, System_Selected_Node_B,
Preferred_Node_A, Preferred_Node_B
- **node_affinity_l10n** (String) Localized message string corresponding to node_affinity
- **nsid** (Number)
- **parent_id** (String)
- **performance_policy_id** (String) Unique identifier of the performance policy assigned to the
volume.
- **protection_policy_id** (String)
Unique identifier of the protection policy assigned to the
volume. Only applicable to primary and clone volumes.
- **resource_id** (String) Unique identifier of the volume instance
- **size** (Number) Size of the volume in bytes. Minimum volume size is 1MB. Maximum volume size is 256TB. Size must be a multiple of 8192.
**Minimum value** : 1048576
**Maximum value** : 281474976710656
- **source_id** (String)
- **source_timestamp** (String)
- **state** (String)
- **state_l10n** (String) Localized message string corresponding to state
- **type** (String) Type of volume.
Allowed Values: Primary, Clone, Snapshot
- **type_l10n** (String) Localized message string corresponding to type.
- **wwn** (String) World wide name of the volume
