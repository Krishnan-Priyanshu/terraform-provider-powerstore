## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.13.x and later
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.13.x and later (to build the provider plugin) 

## Installation

*Note*: This project uses [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) making it safe to work with it outside of your existing [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).  The instructions that follow assume a directory in your home directory outside of the standard GOPATH (i.e `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`).

Clone repository to: `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $HOME/development/terraform-providers/; cd $HOME/development/terraform-providers/
$ git clone https://github.com/dell/terraform-provider-powerstore.git
...
```

Enter the provider directory and run `go build`. This will build the provider and put the provider in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ go build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-PowerStore
...
```
